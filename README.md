# BoardgameListingWebApp

## Description

**Board Game Database Full-Stack Web Application.**
This web application displays lists of board games and their reviews. While anyone can view the board game lists and reviews, they are required to log in to add/ edit the board games and their reviews. The 'users' have the authority to add board games to the list and add reviews, and the 'managers' have the authority to edit/ delete the reviews on top of the authorities of users.  

## Technologies

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Amazon Web Services(AWS) EC2
- Thymeleaf
- Thymeleaf Fragments
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Spring MVC
- JDBC
- H2 Database Engine (In-memory)
- JUnit test framework
- Spring Security
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Maven

## Features

- Full-Stack Application
- UI components created with Thymeleaf and styled with Twitter Bootstrap
- Authentication and authorization using Spring Security
  - Authentication by allowing the users to authenticate with a username and password
  - Authorization by granting different permissions based on the roles (non-members, users, and managers)
- Different roles (non-members, users, and managers) with varying levels of permissions
  - Non-members only can see the boardgame lists and reviews
  - Users can add board games and write reviews
  - Managers can edit and delete the reviews
- Deployed the application on AWS EC2
- JUnit test framework for unit testing

ðŸš€ Building an End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline with DevOpsÂ Tools
In today's fast-paced software world, automation is the backbone of reliable delivery. A well-designed CI/CD pipeline ensures faster development, better code quality, and seamless deployments. In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through how we set up a complete DevOps pipelineâ€Š-â€Šfrom infrastructure to monitoring.
âœ… Automatically builds and tests your Java applications
âœ… Performs security scans with Trivy
âœ… Analyzes code quality with SonarQube (optional)
âœ… Stores artifacts in Nexus Repository
âœ… Builds and publishes Docker images
âœ… Deploys to Kubernetes cluster
âœ… Sends detailed email notifications

Architecture Overview
Our pipeline consists of three main phases:
Infrastructure Setupâ€Š-â€ŠAWS EC2 instances and Kubernetes cluster
Source Code Managementâ€Š-â€ŠGitHub repository setup
CI/CD Pipelineâ€Š-â€ŠJenkins pipeline with multiple stages

---

ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
We started by creating 6 Ubuntu 24.04 instances on AWS EC2. These serve as the backbone for our entire DevOps toolchain:
Instance 1: Jenkins Server (CI/CD Engine)
Instance 2: Nexus Repository Manager
Instance 3: SonarQube Server
Instance 4: Kubernetes Master Node
Instance 5: Kubernetes Worker Node 1
Instance 6: Kubernetes Worker Node 2

Key components installed in Phase 1:
âœ… Docker on all VMs for containerized deployments
âœ… Jenkins as the CI/CD orchestrator
âœ… Trivy integrated for comprehensive vulnerability scanning
âœ… Nexus for artifact repository management
âœ… SonarQube for code quality analysis and technical debt tracking

ðŸ‘‰ Result: A complete DevOps toolchain installed and ready for pipeline automation.


Step 1: Creating AWS EC2 Instances
We'll need six Ubuntu 24.04 instances for our complete setup:
Instance 1: Jenkins Server (CI/CD orchestrator)
Instance 2: Nexus Repository Manager (Artifact storage)
Instance 3: SonarQube Server (Code quality analysis)
Instance 4: Kubernetes Master Node (Control plane)
Instance 5: Kubernetes Worker Node 1 (Application workloads)
Instance 6: Kubernetes Worker Node 2 (Application workloads)

Creating EC2 Instances
Sign in to AWS Console

Navigate to AWS Management Console
Sign in with your credentials

Launch EC2 Instances Navigate to EC2 Dashboard and click Launch Instance
Security Group Configuration by Server Role

Jenkins Server: - Port 22 (SSH) - Port 8080 (Jenkins Web UI)  Nexus Server: - Port 22 (SSH) - Port 8081 (Nexus Web UI)  SonarQube Server: - Port 22 (SSH) - Port 9000 (SonarQube Web UI)  Kubernetes Master: - Port 22 (SSH) - Port 6443 (Kubernetes API Server) - Port 2379-2380 (etcd) - Port 10250 (kubelet) - Port 10251 (kube-scheduler) - Port 10252 (kube-controller-manager)  Kubernetes Workers: - Port 22 (SSH) - Port 10250 (kubelet) - Port 30000-32767 (NodePort services)
<img width="1910" height="1079" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-24 161242" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/674e7e4c-f4d7-4100-a164-3f9be1618d10" />



Step 2: Installing Docker on All Instances
Connect to each of the 6 instances and install Docker following these steps:
First, update your system packages and install prerequisite packages including ca-certificates and curl. Then download and add Docker's official GPG key to your system keyring. Add the Docker repository to your APT sources list, making sure to use the correct architecture and Ubuntu version codename.
Update the package index again and install the Docker packages including docker-ce, docker-ce-cli, and containerd.io. Finally, grant permissions to the Docker socket for easier management and verify the installation by checking the Docker version.
This process needs to be repeated on all 6 servers to ensure Docker is available for containerized deployments across your infrastructure.


Step 3: Setting UpÂ Jenkins
On your Jenkins server instance (Instance 1):
Begin by updating your system and upgrading existing packages. Install Java 17 as it's required for Jenkins to function properly. Download the Jenkins repository key from the official Jenkins website and add it to your system's keyring.
Add the Jenkins repository to your APT sources list, then update the package index and install Jenkins. Once installed, start the Jenkins service and enable it to start automatically on system boot.
Access Jenkins through your web browser using the server's IP address on port 8080. Retrieve the initial admin password from the specified file location, enter it in the web interface, install the suggested plugins, and create your first admin user account.
Access Jenkins at http://your-jenkins-server-ip:8080 and complete the setup wizard.


Step 4: Installing Trivy (Security Scanner)
On the Jenkins server (Instance 1):
Install the prerequisite packages including wget, apt-transport-https, gnupg, and lsb-release. Add the Trivy repository key to your system using wget to download the public key.
Add the Trivy repository to your APT sources list, making sure to use the correct Ubuntu release codename. Update your package index and install Trivy security scanner.
Trivy will be used in our Jenkins pipeline to scan both the filesystem and Docker images for security vulnerabilities.


Step 5: Setting Up Nexus Repository
On your dedicated Nexus server (Instance 2):
Pull the official Nexus Docker image from Sonatype. Create and run a Nexus container with port mapping for port 8081, assign it a name for easy management, and create a volume for persistent data storage.
To get the initial admin password, check the container logs using Docker logs command and look for the password information. The default username is admin.
Access Nexus at http://your-nexus-server-ip:8081 and complete the initial setup wizard.


Step 6: Setting Up SonarQube
On your dedicated SonarQube instance (Instance 3):
Create a Docker network specifically for SonarQube and its PostgreSQL database to enable secure communication between containers.
Run a PostgreSQL container with the necessary environment variables for SonarQube database configuration. Set up database credentials, create the sonarqube database, and configure persistent volume storage for database data.
Next, run the SonarQube container on the same network with proper database connection settings. Configure the JDBC URL to connect to the PostgreSQL database, set database credentials, and create persistent volumes for SonarQube data, extensions, and logs.
Access SonarQube at http://your-sonarqube-server-ip:9000 using the default credentials admin/admin.


Step 7: Setting Up Kubernetes Cluster
Now we'll set up a complete Kubernetes cluster with 1 master and 2 worker nodes.
On the Master Node (Instance 4):
Install Kubernetes Components
First, update the system and install required packages for Kubernetes. Add the Kubernetes signing key and repository to your system. Then update the package index and install kubelet, kubeadm, and kubectl components.
Initialize Kubernetes Master
Use kubeadm to initialize the Kubernetes cluster on the master node. This will set up the control plane components including the API server, etcd, scheduler, and controller manager. After initialization, you'll get a join command that you'll use on worker nodes.
Configure kubectl for the Master Node
Set up the kubeconfig file so you can manage the cluster using kubectl. Copy the admin configuration file to your user's home directory and set appropriate permissions.
Install Pod Network (CNI)
Install a Container Network Interface plugin like Flannel or Calico to enable pod-to-pod communication across the cluster. This is essential for the cluster to function properly.

On Worker Nodes (Instances 5 &Â 6):
Install Kubernetes Components
Repeat the same installation process as the master nodeâ€Š-â€Šupdate system, add Kubernetes repository, and install kubelet and kubeadm.
Join the Cluster
Use the join command that was generated during master initialization to connect each worker node to the cluster. This command includes the master node's IP address and a secure token.
Verify Cluster Setup
From the master node, verify that all nodes have joined the cluster successfully and are in Ready state. Check that system pods are running correctly across all nodes.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Source Code Management
Our codebase was managed on GitHub in a private repository. This ensures security while maintaining version control and collaboration capabilities.
Setting Up Git Repository
Using Git Bash, we established our source code management workflow:
Initialize the repository in your local project directory if not already done. Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin using the repository URL. Stage all your project files for the initial commit.
Create your initial commit with a descriptive message about your DevOps Board Game application. Push your code to GitHub using the main branch, which will serve as the trigger for your automated Jenkins pipeline.
This setup ensures that all builds are triggered directly from GitHub, enabling true continuous integration where every code push automatically initiates our comprehensive pipeline.

---

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
This is where the magic happens! We built a Jenkins declarative pipeline that automated the entire application lifecycle.
ðŸ“§ Email Notifications
After every pipeline run, Jenkins automatically sends an HTML-formatted email notification with:
Build status (SUCCESS/FAILURE) with color-coded banners
Direct links to console output for troubleshooting
Trivy security reports attached for vulnerability review
Professional formatting for team communications
